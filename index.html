<P style= "border: 1px solid powderblue"> The homecoming dance occurred during my fifth month in America. I started getting ready so early that by the time I was ready, I still had half an hour before my ride came. My mind was full of excitement, yet I was still so nervous that I even made up a list of topics that I could discuss with people.</p>

<P style= "border: 1px solid powderblue">My friends came pick me up and we headed to dinner. Beyond my imagination, everything was going smoothly. Then, a girl who I recognized from school approached our table. I wanted to talk to her so I started with a compliment, <I>I like your dress.</I>
She replied, <I>Thanks, I like yours too. You look hot.</I></P>
<P style= "border: 1px solid powderblue">I thought, <B>What does temperature have to do with my dress?</B> I did not want to end our conversation though, so I quickly replied with confidence, <I>Actually I am feeling little cold.</I>. She looked confused and then suddenly gave a loud laugh. As my face turned red, she then explained to me that hot means looks good.
